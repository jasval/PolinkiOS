> they can change the world are the ones who do.”

##Project Aims
The app is meant to act as a hub for political discussion around controversial issues, ensuring a safe environment bridging opposing views. In a world of great political divide and extreme polarisation, we need to explore solutions that seek to bring people together and celebrate contributions from different parties and their diversity.

##Project Objectives
* Identify key functionality that will set this app apart from others in the market.
* Requirements gathering by surveying potential users and identifying differences between demographics.
* Write clean, efficient code that allows for third party libraries integration and networking with a database to store information.
* Test the application by creating unit tests and system-wide tests that challenge and measure performance. Refactor code appropiately.
* Iterate over the development process as much as needed responding to user feedback.
* Explore design alternatives to ensure it engages with our target audience and establishes a visual identity that matches the brand.
