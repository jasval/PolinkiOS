# Project Aims
The app is meant to act as a hub for political discussion around controversial issues, ensuring a safe environment bridging opposing views. In a world of great political divide and extreme polarisation, we need to explore solutions that seek to bring people together and celebrate contributions from different parties and their diversity.
